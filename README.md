Software Engineering web application project with my six other classmates at San Francisco State University.

Project Overview:

An e-commerce website that allows user to sell, buy, trade used book at minimum cost.

The two main objectives of the website is to allow users to get books they
need at minimum cost from what they would pay in the school bookstore or other online
bookstore as well as help the users who want to clear their used books.

With iSharebook, a person can list books that they no longer need
and set a fair price for them; other people searching for books can visit the web app and, if they
locate the book they want, they can contact the vendor and complete purchases. The customer
will benefit from not having to spend a substantial sum of money on the books, whilst the seller
will get a fair price for the book he or she no longer requires. “Share Book Share Knowledge! ”
is our mantra, and it is one that we adhere to.
